ApplPi
======

A stochastic noise machine implemented in Java, a "reimplementation of the Freeverb project". Originally created by [D Hollingsworth](https://github.com/hollingsworthd) and moved [to sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/p/applpi). Affero GPL(v3?). 

Except the jar was packaged by svn. That meant adjusting the file extensions back to .java so people can edit them in a VCS agnostic way.

Main effort on _radios branch_ .
