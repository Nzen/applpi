ApplPi
======

A stochastic noise machine implemented in Java, a "reimplementation of the Freeverb project". Originally created by [https://github.com/hollingsworthd D Hollingsworth] and moved [to sourceforge  https://sourceforge.net/p/applpi].

Except the jar was packaged by svn. That meant adjusting the file extensions back to .java so people can edit them in a VCS agnostic way.
