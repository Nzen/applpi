ApplPi 3.A
======

A stochastic noise machine implemented in Java, a "reimplementation of the Freeverb project". Originally created by [D Hollingsworth](https://github.com/hollingsworthd) and moved [to sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/p/applpi). Affero GPL(v3?). 

Except the jar was packaged by svn. That meant adjusting the file extensions back to .java so people can edit them in a VCS agnostic way.

But that was largely in service of this branch: changing the gui. His has arrow keys to move through the different noise stations. As a user, I'd rather select what I like. And now you can; all 12 varieties are available as radio buttons.
